# Machine Learning and the Hall of Fame
## Introduction

The National Baseball Hall of Fame inducted its first eligible members in 1936.  Soon after, in 1939, the Baseball Hall of Fame Museum was opened in Cooperstown, NY.  Since its establishment, each year members of the Baseball Writer's Association of America (BBWAA) vote on eligible candidates to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  Major League Baseball players are considered eligible candidates if the baseball player:

* Was an active MLB player at least 15 years prior to the year of the election.
* Has been retired for at least 5 years prior to the election.
* Has played in a minimum of 10 seasons.
* Cannot be on the Baseball Hall of Fame ineligible list.  

I would have a sentence here that would continue and my get in the way of the image.
